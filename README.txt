Create centralized control over who can see & edit which media items on CC.

== Description ==

This plugin sets up the basic media restrictions for non-admin users on a site.
It assumes that a subscriber should:
* only see the media that she's uploaded to the site when using the Media library
* only see the media that she's uploaded to the site when using the "Add Media" modal
* be able to edit and delete media that she has uploaded.

The filters happen at early priorities so that other plugins can change the
behavior at later priorities.
